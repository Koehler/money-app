# money-app
Sample App for managing accounts and transactions.

#### Project Setup

For setting up this project you need the following tools.
- Eclipse IDE for Java EE Developers (https://eclipse.org/downloads/)
- MySQL (http://www.mysql.de/)

I'am tired of writing getters and setters. So i decided to use lombok (http://projectlombok.org/).
The only thing you need to do, is adding the jar to your eclipse classpath by executing lombok.jar 
(doubleclick it, or run java -jar lombok.jar) and follow the instructions (select you eclipse.ini).

If you don't want to use lombok or having trouble with setup, just generate the getters and setters in the entity classes.
